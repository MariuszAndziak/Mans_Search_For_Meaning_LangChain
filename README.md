[![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/languge-english-blue.svg)](https://shields.io/)

> The quest for the meaning of life is one of the fundamental strugles of human existence. It's a complex topic that cannot be easily resolved through a single data project. Nonetheless, uncovering meaningful insights can still be informative, even if it doesn't offer a definitive answer to a profound philosophical conundrum.

> The project focuses on a book "[Man's Search for Meaning](https://www.amazon.com/Mans-Search-Meaning-Viktor-Frankl-ebook/dp/B009U9S6FI)" by [Viktor Frankl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Frankl).

> Realizacja w ramach projektu NLP grupy Warszawsko-Międzymiastowo-Międzynarodowej
