              "\"\\n\\nViktor Frankl believed that the meaning of life is found in every individual's unique search for meaning, which is largely determined by the person's attitude and individual interpretations of a set of circumstances. He argued that humans have a natural instinct to search for meaning and purpose, and that this was the primary motivation in life. He believed that in order to find meaning, we must invest our time and energy in something greater than ourselves, such as a meaningful job, a relationship with God, or a meaningful cause. He also believed that meaning can be found even in difficult circumstances and that each person has the potential to use the worst circumstances to fashion the best possible outcome.\""
